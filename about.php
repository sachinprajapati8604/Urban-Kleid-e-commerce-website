                <h2 class="h2 text-center mt-4">OUR FACTORY</h2>
                <p class=""><strong>Made in the INDIA </strong> – All of our organic cotton is sourced from premium
                    spinning mills. The yarn is then sent to our partner factory, a vertically integrated
                    state-of-the-art facility in Los Angeles, for knitting. The fabric then goes through a premium dying
                    process, ensuring all chemicals are azo-free and environmentally friendly. Design, cutting, sewing,
                    quality control, packaging, and other procedures are completed in-house before the finished products
                    are sent to the neighboring storage and fulfilment facility.
                    <br> <br>
                    <strong> Sustainable</strong> – This isn’t just a nice-to-have for us; it's a necessity. We’ve
                    partnered with one of the leading state-of-the-art factories in California that guarantees fair
                    wages, reasonable hours, and excellent working conditions. We want everyone involved in the
                    production cycle of our high quality T-shirts to thrive. The more we sell, the better for everyone.
                    <br> <br>
                    <strong> Quality</strong> Control – Every high quality T-shirt goes through a thorough quality
                    control process to ensure consistent excellence. Our T-shirts are made with care and precision,
                    using over 20 measurements, with very strict tolerances. This means that once you’ve discovered your
                    perfect size, you can re-order with confidence, knowing that your new T-shirt will fit you just like
                    the last one.

                    Longevity – We put every batch of fabric through multiple shrink tests to create a highly accurate
                    pre-wash spec, and then garment wash each T-shirt in order to create the desired post-wash spec.
                    This means that our T-shirts retain their original shape and quality, wash after wash.

                <h2 class="h2 text-center mt-4">OUR PRODUCTS</h2>
                <p class=""><strong> Exceptional Fabric</strong> – Super soft and refreshingly light, you have to
                    experience our rich, organic cotton to believe it. We know that it’s so important to feel
                    comfortable and free in your high quality T-shirt, so we’ve taken the time to source one of the
                    finest natural fabrics available on the market. The careful construction and using a tight gauge
                    guarantee that your T-shirt will stay supremely strong and durable over time, even with daily wears
                    and washes.
                    <br> <br>
                    <strong> Incredible Fit </strong> – There’s nothing more important than getting the right fit. Our
                    signature cut is semi-fitted, which means it’s not too tight and not too loose. There's just the
                    right amount of fabric around the neck, shoulders, chest, armholes, sleeves and length to shape to
                    your physique, and the shorter sleeves give added comfort, flexibility of movement, and a
                    classically sexy look. The cut gives you the option of two sizes – one loose and one fitted.
                    <br> <br>
                    <strong> 100% Organic Cotton (GOTS Certified) certificate # is 0T-023558 </strong> – Unlike
                    synthetic fibers, our 100% natural cotton allows your skin to breathe and never itch. We are also
                    committed to sourcing organic cotton so that no pesticides or fertilizers are used in production.
                    This protects cotton farmers and our planet’s water table from harsh chemicals, preserving a healthy
                    future for our children.
